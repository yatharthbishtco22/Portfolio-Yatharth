    "summary": "🚀 AI Developer | LLMs | Full-Stack Engineer | Generative AI Enthusiast\n\nI'm a pre-final year student at DTU who's already deep in the AI game. From building detection and segmentation models 🧠 to deploying my own nano-GPT for Shakespearean verse generation 🎭, I believe in learning by building.\n\n🛠️ Interned at DraftAI (fine-tuned LLMs using HuggingFace) & SUNIC Tech (container ID recognition under CONCOR). Researched ML for smart waste segregation at IIT Delhi.\n\n🤖 Deeply passionate about GenAI — built RAG systems, fine-tuned LLMs, and created intelligent AI agents. Projects like LegalEase & OpenAPI Spec Generator showcase my ability to turn cutting-edge models into real-world tools.\n\n📱 Built LegalEase – auto-generates legal docs from minimal input. Also crafted an OpenAPI spec generator for any CRM (Gemini Long Context Challenge 🧩).\n\n💻 Full-stack dev with scraping/automation tools using Selenium, Playwright & BeautifulSoup. Backend magic with Flask, Express, NodeJS; frontend skills in HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n⚡ Also worked with Kafka for distributed streaming, Docker for deployments & Rust for high-performance modules. All about scalable, efficient engineering.\n\n📈 Currently building a startup in AI – collaborated with Langchain’s cofounder, contributed to CrewAI, and growing fast.\n\nLet’s connect & build something epic! 🌐",
